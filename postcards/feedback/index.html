		<h2>Aesthetic</h2>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>Some of the images do relate (I like the first one of lily) but I think the images you have for the second quote don't relate as well</li>
			<li>Think about using the the same image for both desktop and mobile (or at least similar images like you did with your first postcard) to keep the design more consistant</li>
			<li>Contast in image of the mobile version of the second postcard and the desktop version of first postcard in low</li>
			<li>Font does relate to aesthetic but could be better</li>
			<li>Very legible and consistant aesthetic!</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Structure</h2>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>Rethink how you use the transparent boxes around the text (doesn't really work with desktop version of first postcard</li>
			<li>The text in the monbile version of your second postacard seems stuck in the top and is a little awkward the way it overlaps with the image</li>
			<li>Type size seems too similar between mobile and desktop versions</li>
			<li>Keep font size,leading more consistant between mobile versions and consistant between desktop versions</li>
			<li>The rag on the desktop version of the last postard is weird</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

		<h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
	</div>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li>Add quotation marks</li>
			<li>Quality of images can be improved</li>
			<li>In your quote: "Paper cut... Death is all around us." Death probably shouldn't be capitalized and the dots seem like they need some tracking between them.</li>
			<li>Try to find pictures without the network logo on them</li>
		</ul>
